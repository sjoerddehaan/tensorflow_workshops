# How to get started
You can run the notebooks in this repository live on http://www.mybinder.org/ by clicking this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sjoerddehaan/tensorflow_workshops/master).

This spins up a Jupyter notebook environment. Jupyter is a great development platform for data science. If you are not familliar with Jupyter, watch this video: [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: Introduction, Setup, and Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)

# What knowledge is assumed?
You need basic knowledge of Python and the Numpy library for matrix computation. The online course "Intro to Python for Data Science" covers allmost everything, except loops and conditions. It takes about five hours to complete. If you are not familliar with loops and conditions in Python, you can work through two seperate tutorials, listed below.
